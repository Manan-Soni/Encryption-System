# Da-Vinci's Cryptex
<h2>This repository contains my encryption system project.</h2>

A cryptex, as popularized by Dan Brown's novel "The Da Vinci Code," is a fictional device used to hide secret messages. The term "cryptex" itself is a blend of "cryptology" and "codex."

<h3>Description of the Cryptex</h3>
<p>
Design: The cryptex is designed as a cylindrical container with rotating discs on the outside. Each disc has letters of the alphabet, and when aligned correctly, they spell out a password.

Mechanism: The internal mechanism of the cryptex includes a lock that only opens when the correct password is spelled out by aligning the discs. Inside the cryptex, there is usually a hidden message or object.

Protection: In "The Da Vinci Code," the cryptex also has a vial of vinegar inside. If someone tries to force it open without knowing the correct password, the vial breaks and the vinegar dissolves the papyrus scroll inside, thus destroying the secret message.

<h3>Real-World Application</h3>
While the cryptex as described in "The Da Vinci Code" is a fictional creation, it has inspired real-world enthusiasts and puzzle makers to create functional versions. These real-world cryptexes are often used as puzzle boxes, gifts, or novelty items.
