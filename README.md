# Da-Vinci's Cryptex
<h2>This repository contains my encryption system project.</h2>

A cryptex, as popularized by Dan Brown's novel "The Da Vinci Code," is a fictional device used to hide secret messages. The term "cryptex" itself is a blend of "cryptology" and "codex."

<h3>Description of the Cryptex</h3>
<p>
Design: The cryptex is designed as a cylindrical container with rotating discs on the outside. Each disc has letters of the alphabet, and when aligned correctly, they spell out a password.

Mechanism: The internal mechanism of the cryptex includes a lock that only opens when the correct password is spelled out by aligning the discs. Inside the cryptex, there is usually a hidden message or object.
